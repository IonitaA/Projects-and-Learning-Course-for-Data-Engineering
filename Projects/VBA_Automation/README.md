# Excel Data Import and Processing in VBA

This project includes a VBA script that facilitates importing and processing data from a selected Excel file into various existing worksheets.

## Features

1. **File Reading**
   - The code opens a dialog box to select an Excel file and automatically defines the source and destination worksheets.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Data from the imported file is transferred into a tabular format and organized by categories, such as "Furnizare" (Supply), "Altele" (Others), "Distribu»õie" (Distribution), "Clienti incerti" (Uncertain Clients), and "Factura Penalitate" (Penalty Invoice).
   - The imported data is processed and filtered to remove unwanted characters and validate dates against the current year.

3. **Aggregation and Saving**
   - The code aggregates data by calculating sums and counts for each category, and saves the results to the respective worksheets.

4. **Optimization and Completion**
   - The script optimizes performance by disabling recalculations and visual updates, formats specific columns, and displays a confirmation message upon completion.
