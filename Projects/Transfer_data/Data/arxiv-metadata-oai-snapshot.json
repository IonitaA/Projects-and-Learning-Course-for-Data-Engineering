The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

The parameter\nspace of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large\nradii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the\ntargets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active\nstars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,\ncoronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity\nwill extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric\nmethods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.\n  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods\ndemonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap\nfor exoplanet discovery and characterization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2007 17:14:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bower", "Geoffrey C.", "", "Berkeley"], ["Bolatto", "Alberto", "", "Berkeley"], ["Ford", "Eric", "", "CfA, Florida"], ["Kalas", "Paul", "", "Berkeley"], ["Ulvestad", "Jim", "", "NRAO"]]}

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\nless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial\nbinary content of globular clusters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2007 23:53:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hurley", "Jarrod R.", ""], ["Aarseth", "Sverre J.", ""], ["Shara", "Michael M.", ""]]}

We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate.

At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears\nat the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin\nstates contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic\nferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti\nconcentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck\nto achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.\nThis study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity\nin ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based\ntechnology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2007 06:41:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Maiti", "Kalobaran", ""]]}

Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the\nstars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August\n2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\nyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\nmembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\nthick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\nsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\nparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\nderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise\nthe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a\nsubsequent publication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2007 09:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ducourant", "C.", ""], ["Teixeira", "R.", ""], ["Hambly", "N.

We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2007 11:02:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2007 15:49:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:29:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Szollosi", "Gergely J", ""], ["Derenyi", "Imre", ""]]}

We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole).

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2007 11:58:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 14:42:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2007 22:08:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 14 Jun 2007 01:34:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 15 Sep 2007 05:40:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chkareuli", "J.

We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory.

We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2007 20:08:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kawata", "Daisuke", ""], ["Rauch", "Michael", ""]]}

Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy.

Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2007 13:55:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2007 03:12:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2007 11:49:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Z.", ""], ["Podsiadlowski", "Ph.", ""], ["Lynas-Gray", "A.

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\nrelativistic electrons.\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\nambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the\ndegree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of\nthe microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models\nand observations.\n  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be\nexplained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic\nfield strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging\nsimilar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2007 14:13:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Orlando", "S.", ""], ["Bocchino", "F.", ""], ["Reale", "F.", ""], ["Peres", "G.", ""], ["Petruk", "O.", ""]]}

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed.

Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2007 21:58:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Moura", "Jose M.

In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high.

The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the\nspeed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If\nthe emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves\ntowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend\non the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed\nin all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us\nis large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be\nobserved for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees\nwith current observations.

At first\nsight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point\nof view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases\nfundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of\nfunctions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but\nGuseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal\nSlater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a\ndangerous operation whose validity must be checked.

The relative age and metallicity\nsensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,\nH, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for\nbreaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty\nparameter (UP) method.

In\ndetail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best\npairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities.

We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity.

The systemic\nvelocity inferred from the optically thin lines agrees within 3km/s with the\ncentral velocity of the maser emission for most of the sources. About 64% of\nthe sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CS\nspecies, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of the\nwidths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser\nline traces the environment of MYSO of various kinematic regimes. Therefore\nconditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of\nmolecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts\nassociated with molecular outflows. Calculations of the physical conditions\nbased on the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios refine the\ninput parameters for maser models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2007 11:44:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Szymczak", "M.", ""], ["Bartkiewicz", "A.", ""], ["Richards", "A.

The optical photometry was\ncalibrated through the S-correction technique.\n  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble\nthose of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)\nmag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5).

Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2007 16:42:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2007 15:26:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zdeborov\u00e1", "Lenka", ""], ["Krzakala", "Florent", ""]]}

We study the resulting differentially\nrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The\npredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate.

We examine the validity of this reconstruction\nalgorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a\ntarget. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional\nprojection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo\nCluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major\naxis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member\ngalaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified\nreconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of\nthe triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with\nthe recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the\nrobustness of the reconstruction algorithm.

The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of\nthe clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations\nperpendicular to high symmetry axes.

Can we establish a robust\nclassification scheme so that objects with unusual values of log(g) or [M/H],\nunusual dust content, or unresolved binarity are easily recognized? (2) Which\nphysical processes drive the unusual behavior at the L/T transition? Which\nobservations can be obtained to better confine the problem? (3) What will\nobjects cooler than T8 look like? How will we know a Y dwarf when we first\nobserve one?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 04:32:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kirkpatrick", "J.

One of the typical features shown by observations of solar\nprominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of\nthe damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding\noscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is\nstill not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick\nradiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their\nrole on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The\ndispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived\nconsidering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an\nunbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel\nto the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the\ndispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is\nobtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect\nof conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode\nand depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the\ninternal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the\nfast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and\nthe external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external\ncorona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow\nmodes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all.

The\nintrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to\n10^{10.3} years.

A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33\nfield stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater\nthan 99.9% confidence level.

We faced that problem on the\nbasis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical\ntranslation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice\nversa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD.

In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure\nequations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the\nprediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the\nconstruction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 17:30:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2007 15:25:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Beuthe", "Mikael", ""]]}

We advocate an alternative hypothesis,\nthat the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very\nclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.\nWe conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions\nrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close\nsupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to\nescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss\noccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the\ndisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These\nlow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the\nhigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk\nbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be\nconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On\nthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into\ndust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be\ninjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic\nabundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are\nconsistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1\npc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 19:48:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ouellette", "N.", ""], ["Desch", "S.

The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN\nwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their\nspectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity\nFunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with\nprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our\ndata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us\nto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By\ncombining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted\nfrom the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different\nevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the\ncombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is\na luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived\nfrom the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the\nAGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the\nexcess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we\nfind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that\nthe peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift\ngoing to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of\nX-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of \"AGN cosmic\ndownsizing\", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to\nmore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than\nthat of low luminosity ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 20:21:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bongiorno", "A.", ""], ["Zamorani", "G.", ""], ["Gavignaud", "I.", ""], ["Marano", "B.", ""], ["Paltani", "S.", ""], ["Mathez", "G.", ""], ["Picat", "J.

Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the\neffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.\n  Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar\nmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched\nfor close-in planets using the transit technique.\n  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m),\nand the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability\nwe also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational\ncampaign.

Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791\nbe similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed\nsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets.

In this manuscript we report the\ndiscovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The\nkilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state\nreminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO\npeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single\ntrial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency\nhave only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09.

The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the\nhighest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc\nfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent\nflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of\nthe weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected.

In this paper, we first present an unified view of these\nproofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing\nargument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an\nintegration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these\ningredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual\ninformation inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information\ninequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\'u used in\nearlier proofs.

At\nlast, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks\nand we suggest how the performance can be improved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2007 15:53:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Apr 2007 15:40:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 17:25:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bistarelli", "Stefano", ""], ["Montanari", "Ugo", ""], ["Rossi", "Francesca", ""], ["Santini", "Francesco", ""]]}

This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from\nconsiderations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear\nBH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how\nprimordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function\ndeclines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation\nis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation\nbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for\ngalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and\na convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A\ncurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are\nformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would\ncorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger\ncentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some\nother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge\nrelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random\nmerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather\nthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation.

Orbital free methods attempt to\ncalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the\nuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local\napproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise\ngenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic\npotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in\nthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic\npotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated\napproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the\nvalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two\nnonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for\nboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact\nresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to\nsmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate\nand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying\nvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free\nDF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local\npseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic\npotentials.

Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Apr 2007 19:42:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bloom", "Jesse D.", ""], ["Lu", "Zhongyi", ""], ["Chen", "David", ""], ["Raval", "Alpan", ""], ["Venturelli", "Ophelia S.", ""], ["Arnold", "Frances H.", ""]]}

As\nadditional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the\nlogic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Apr 2007 19:59:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Marcelino", "S\u00e9rgio", ""], ["Resende", "Pedro", ""]]}

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2007 01:58:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2007 09:30:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2007 08:13:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Graham", "J.

We\nextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfert\ngalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images to\nstudy their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated\ngalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be\nsuccessfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic\nof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07).

The key problem, that we\ntry to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL\nPomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :\n(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic\ninterpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a\nHamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the\nsecond is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather\ncomplicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be\nreduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space\nif the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the\ntransverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of\nLangevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one\nintegrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL\nPomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$\nof Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two\nprocesses: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into\none dipole. However, a number of assumptions we have to make on the way to\nsimplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and/or to apply the\nprobabilistic interpretation, therefore, we can consider both of these\napproaches in the present form only as the QCD motivated models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 10:08:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2007 14:08:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kozlov", "M.", ""], ["Levin", "E.", ""], ["Prygarin", "A.", ""]]}

Materials and methods: We have used\nmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of\nindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate\nof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their\noffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At\nleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of\nmitochondria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 10:30:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Tomelleri", "C.", ""], ["Milotti", "E.", ""], ["Pellegrina", "C.

Depending on inclination, the B-band\nattenuation correction varies from 0.2 -- 1.1 mag for discs and from 0.8 -- 2.6\nmag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B-band photons\nproduced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure that\nrises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of internal dust\nextinction is such that one must incorporate internal dust corrections in all\noptical studies of large galaxy samples. This is particularly pertinent for\noptical HST comparative evolutionary studies as the dust properties will also\nbe evolving.

We present several\noptimally-tuned photonic molecule designs for lowering thresholds of\nsemiconductor microlasers, producing directional light emission, enhancing\nsensitivity of microcavity-based bio(chemical)sensors, and optimizing\nelectromagnetic energy transfer around bends of coupled-cavity waveguides.\nPhotonic molecules composed of identical microcavities as well as of\nmicrocavities with various degrees of size or material detuning are discussed.\nMicrowave experiments on scaled photonic molecule structures are currently\nunder way to confirm our theoretical predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 19:56:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Boriskina", "Svetlana V.", ""], ["Benson", "Trevor M.", ""], ["Sewell", "Phillip", ""]]}

The main goals of this analysis of\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of 100 micron dust emission are\n1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in three\ndimensions, 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise due\nto dust emission and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproduce\nthe observed statistical properties. The main results are the following. 1) The\ncirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously\noverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where\n<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in\naccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a\ngiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing\namplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust\nemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average\nbut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have\nsystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and\nkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong\nnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power\nspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function\nof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification\nof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 15:16:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Miville-Deschenes", "M. -A.", "", "IAS, CITA"], ["Lagache", "G.", "", "IAS"], ["Boulanger", "F.", "", "IAS"], ["Puget", "J. -L.", "", "IAS"]]}

Due to their\ninherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their\nmorphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the\nhigh angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study\nthe quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range\n0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative\nsample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional\nsurface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four\nfilters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological\nclassification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to\ndetermine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially\nidentified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity\nin the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them\nfrom HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of\nintermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%,\nEarly types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs are\nintermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\\odot})=10.32.\nWe also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65\n$M_{\\odot}$/year using Spitzer 24$\\mu m$ data.

We study and compare three well defined\nsamples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX.

On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame\nafterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration,\nimplies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dust\ncomposition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is\nprobably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z\nGRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due\nto the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of\nhigh redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of\neven 10m class telescopes.

How the electroweak\ngauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions\nfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standard\nmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &\nEnglert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum\nstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual\nphase symmetry of electromagnetism.

In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of\nbreathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1,\nand finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry\nanalysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in\nthe last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which\nhave an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are\ndetermined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.\nSimilarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a\nfour-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,\nMonge-Ampere type equation.\n  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS\ndescription of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which\nensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle\nshrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional\nbase.

The lack of any bright SN down to\nvery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,\nstrikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present\nspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the\nburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break\nis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the\nbreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour\nand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best\nexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow\nlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is\nstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break\nfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times\nand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at\nhigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray\nlight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended\nemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that\nthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT\nobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits\nit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24\nkeV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however\ndistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.\nConsidering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent\nwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 20:14:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Mangano", "V.", ""], ["Holland", "S.

Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting.
